# Library System Debugging Challenge

## Project Overview

This project is a small library system designed for debugging practice. Your task is to identify and fix bugs in the helper functions.

## File Structure

- **Main application:** `src/challenge/index.js`
- **Bugs to fix:** `src/challenge/helpers.js`
- **Solutions:** `src/challenge/solution/` (commented)

## Getting Started

### Running the Application
```bash
npm run challenge
```

### Running the Tests
```bash
npm run challenge:test
```

## Important Notes

- **To see runtime errors:** Run the app with `npm run challenge`
- **To verify your fixes:** Run the tests with `npm run challenge:test`
- **Need help?** Check the commented solutions in `src/challenge/solution/`

## Debugging Process

1. Run the app to see what errors occur
2. Identify the problematic code in `helpers.js`
3. Fix the bugs
4. Run the tests to confirm your fixes work
5. Compare with the provided solutions if needed
